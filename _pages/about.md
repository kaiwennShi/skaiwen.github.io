I'm an undergraduate student at University of Michigan. Currently, I'm advised by Professor Pierre Apostolides to understand the representation of the auditory information, such as the sound envelope and ultrasonic vocalization, in mice auditory midbrain. Before that, I worked in Professor Jiayi Zhang's lab to investigate the potentials of an artificial photoreceptor in restoring primary visual functions at Fudan University. 

I'm broadly interested in the mechanism by which the brain represents sensory information and and use them to guide behavior and decision. I attempt to study them through combination of neuron imaging and quantative approaches, including machine learning and geometry approaches.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
